## Project Overview
Welcome to the Open Data Toronto Hackathon project! Our goal is to enhance the accessibility and usability of the Open Data Toronto webpage. In this 24-hour hackathon, we've formed three teams: Data Science, Software, and UI/UX. Each team plays a crucial role in making Toronto's open data more accessible and valuable to the general public.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
